# cardimax

Cardimax was a project developed in Medical Robotics class in Lisbon University for the Biomedical Engineering course. 

We, as three engineering students, decided to create a device (inside baymax) that measures you heart rate and creates a different light effect according to your mood. It also controls a Python playlist that has three setings: HIGH (for high heart frequencies), MEDIUM and LOW.

Materials used include:
- BITalino board (http://bitalino.com)
- Arduino Pro-mini (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Arduin...)
- Pulse Sensor (http://pulsesensor.com)
- 2 RGB clear LEDs
- 3D printed baymax (from Disney's movie Big Hero 6, 3D model scaled fromhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:552308)

Files description:
-	ard_bit.ino: code for arduino (we used an arduino pro mini 3.3V)
-	cardimax.py: main file, the one that you may run when the bitalino is already connected to Arduino
-	bitalino.py and .mp3 files are only needed to run the cardimax.py file.
